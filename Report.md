Chart of the loss function for agent using DQN with Vector Observation space size (per agent) 37
The algorithm was DQN, model contains 5 fully connected layers with relu as activation functions.

The code is provided for using double dqn.

It is provided also the Solution with the pixel input using DQN with a convolutional neural network and Dueling DQNs.

Future work could be put priority experience.
